Vocals
======

Vocals is a voice recognition software that let you send any keyboard commands to the application of your choice. 

This version modified by myself.
Changes I made:
*Fixed Alt and Shift.
*Allows multiple modifier keys.
*Added 2 seperate toggle sounds. 1 for on and 1 for off.
*Toggle button added to main interface.
